    "A vibrant classroom scene in the late afternoon. Sunlight streams through the windows, casting long shadows across the desks. Otokonoko, a student, leans slightly towards Onnanoko, another student, with a curious and slightly hopeful expression. Otokonoko asks, Hey, did you finish the homework? Onnanoko is smiling brightly, looking confident and relaxed, as she replies, Of course! It was easy. The classroom is tidy, with textbooks and notebooks on the desks, suggesting a typical school environment.",
    "A young Otokonoko, looking frustrated and confused, lets out a deep sigh. He is saying, I didn't understand it at all... He is sitting at a desk, surrounded by open textbooks and scattered notes, perhaps in a quiet study room or a dimly lit classroom after hours. His head is slightly bowed, and his shoulders are slumped, conveying a sense of intellectual struggle and mild despair. The scene is rendered with detailed illustration, soft, ambient lighting, and expressive facial features that highlight his confusion."
