cene: A high school classroom in Japan during late afternoon. The room is bathed in the warm, golden glow of the sunset coming through the windows. Shadows are long.
Kenji (A teenage boy with messy brown hair and a loose tie, looking anxious and leaning forward): "Hey Aiko, did you actually finish the math homework? It was impossible!"
Aiko (A teenage girl with long black hair, wearing a neat school uniform, smiling confidently while holding up a notebook): "Of course! It was easy once you figured out the formula."
Kenji (Sighing deeply, slumping over his desk in defeat, scratching his head): "I didn't understand it at all... I'm doomed."
